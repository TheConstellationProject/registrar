## Registrar

## <img src="purple.png">

The Arachnid Registrar handles all `.spdr` and `.spider` domain registrations on the Arachnid Network (https://arachnid.cc/). It can be accessed on Arachnid http://registrar.spdr/. It consists of the [API](#api-endpoints), [Database](#database), and [UI](#ui). The backend is written in go using [echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo) and [badger](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger).



### Configuration

Configuration of the registrar can be managed by the `config.yml` file in the root directory. This file includes all the configuration options for this program. The `config.yml` file is included in the repository and contains a default config for use with a proxy. Please note that if you use this registrar as a service on Arachnid, please change the TLDs in `config.yml` as to not interfere with the official Arachnid TLDs.



### Installation

After installing Go, run `make all` to install, build, and run the server.

### Database

The database is a basic key/value store using [badger](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger). Domain data is encoded into a [gob](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/) and passed into badger as a byte slice. All data is stored in the `db/` directory.

Badger provides a binary for backing up the database. This binary is not bundled with the registrar, instead it is part of badger. `go get -u github.com/dgraph-io/badger/badger` and run `badger` located in `$GOPATH/bin/badger`. To create the backup, run:

```bash
badger backup --dir db/
```

Copy `badger.bak` to your backup location. To restore, copy `badger.bak` to your current directory and run:

```bash
badger restore --dir db/
```

 Built in backup support via the badger API coming soon.
